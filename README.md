Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript

## What is a Programming Paradigm?

Programming paradigms are different ways or styles in which a given program or programming language can be organized. Each paradigm consists of certain structures, features, and opinions about how common programming problems should be tackled.

## Popular Programming Paradigms

-   Imperative Programming
-   Procedural Programming
-   Functional Programming
-   Declarative Programming
-   Object-Oriented Programming

## Object Oriented Programming

One of the most popular programming paradigms is object-oriented programming (OOP).

The core concept of OOP is to separate concerns into entities which are coded as objects. Each entity will group a given set of information (properties) and actions (methods) that can be performed by the entity.

OOP makes heavy usage of classes (which are a way of creating new objects starting out from a blueprint or boilerplate that the programmer sets). Objects that are created from a class are called instances.
